# Cryptocurrency-Trading-LLM-Assistant

This is a semester project assignment for UCD Module [Generative AI: Language Models (COMP47980)](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=COMP47980). The goal was to use OpenAI's Assistants API to design and develop a more domain-specific LLM-based assistant than ChatGPT3.5. The LLM-based service should not be easily replicated by just chatting with ChatGPT and must have added value for the user. The popular and rapidly evolving domain of cryptocurrencies, as ChatGPT3.5 lacks current knowledge of the cryptomarket due to its training with data from early 2022.

The repository contains the following files and folders:

- ***crypto_trading_assistant_chat.ipynb***: chat with the LLM assistant.
- ***functions.py***: Functions that use APIs to collect up-to-date information for the LLM.
- ***crypto_assistant.py***: Crypto-Assistant class.
- ***Christos_Charisis_Project_Report.pdf***: Submitted detailed report on the project for further information on the implementation and example results.
- ***RAG_files*** (Folder): Files that were explored for RAG.

## Notes

Python 3.8 was used. OpenAI API Key is not provided, as it is chargeable, and a placeholder is in its place inside ***crypto_assistants.py***. Both .docx files were publicly available on Binance and Coinbase websites .
